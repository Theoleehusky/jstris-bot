# Jstris Bot
(Still WIP on the algorithm)
Heavily inspired by mkhan45's work. Configured for multiplayer (to beat your friends in a private lobby). First piece is hard dropped.

## Setup
Takes screenshots on a 1920x1080 monitor. 
An account is logged into the website, and the monitor is in split-screen mode, with the website on the left.
The coordinates of screenshots can be changed for different setups.


## Imports
* pyautogui for screenshots
* numpy for algorithms
* import keyboard
* numba for efficiency

## Configuration
Make sure ghost is disabled in settings.
